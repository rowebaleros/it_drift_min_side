    <div class="career start">
         <p>Paul George declared for the 2010 nba draft right out of Fresno State College, and at the 10th pick in the 1st round of the 2010 nba draft, he was drafted by the Indiana Pacers where he stayed until 2017 when he requested a trade to the Oklahoma City Thunder, to join forces with prime time Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony and Steven Adams. he stayed in Oklahoma for 2 years, before making his way to one of the teams he rooted for since he was a child, the Los Angeles Clippers where he then joined forces with Kawhi Leonard, Bones Hyland and was reunited with his old teammate from the Oklahoma City Thunder, Russell Westbrook.
            Paul George was looking unstoppable last season, hopefully he will come back better and stronger for the upcoming nba season.</p>
