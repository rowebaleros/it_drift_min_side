                   I like making web-layouts on Adobe XD and love making designs for things like clothing apparel on Adobe illustrator. Besides designing, i like to make websites on Visual Studio Code. I have always been curious of how websites were created sinced i was a child. Once i realized that all these websitres were created by codes, i started to become even more curious as i grew older.
